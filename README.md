## 👽 Greetings Fellow Dev

Building tech is <strong>awesome</strong> but sometimes I like to have a break to appreciate nature and take a breath of fresh-air to clear my mind.

<br>

Keeping up with the industry is a must and that's why I always try to keep:

- 📖 Learning (Building the fundamentals).
- 🔍 Exploring (Leaving the comfort zone).
- 👻 Doing something (Something is better than nothing).

<br>

Here you can find some of the projects I have built. Hope you find them interesting.
