## 👽 Greetings Fellow Developer!

Absolute sci-fi lover and coding brings that joy to my life. Building tech is awesome and possibilites are endless! Finding the balance between life and work can be hard and that's why I enjoy going on walks in the countryside to appreciate nature and clear my mind from time to time.

<br>

<i>"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."</i> - <strong>An alien out there</strong>

<br>

Keeping up with the industry is a must and that's why I always try to keep:

- 📖 Learning (Building the fundamentals).
- 🔍 Exploring (Leaving the comfort zone).
- 👻 Doing something (Something is better than nothing).

<br>

Here you can find some of the projects I have built. Hope you find them interesting.
