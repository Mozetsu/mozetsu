## 👽 Greetings Fellow Developer!

Building tech is awesome and possibilites are endless, there's so much to be created! Nature can be fascinating as well, and that's why I enjoy going on walks in the countryside from time to time to clear my mind.

## Keeping up with the industry is a must and that's why I always try to keep:

- 📖 Learning (Building the fundamentals).
- 🔍 Exploring (Leaving the comfort zone).
- 👻 Doing something (Something is better than nothing).

<br>

## Tech I use:
