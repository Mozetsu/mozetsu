## 👽 Greetings Fellow Developer!

Building tech is awesome and possibilites are endless, there's so much to be created! However, the world has plenty of beauty out there and that's why I enjoy going on walks in the countryside to appreciate nature and clear my mind from time to time.

<i>"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."</i> - <strong>An alien out there</strong>

<br>

Keeping up with the industry is a must and that's why I always try to keep:

- 📖 Learning (Building the fundamentals).
- 🔍 Exploring (Leaving the comfort zone).
- 👻 Doing something (Something is better than nothing).

<br>

Here you can find some of the projects I have built. Hope you find them interesting.
